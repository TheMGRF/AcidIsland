Survival Island
==========

# Introduction
SurvivalIsland is a fork of the AcidIsland add-on for BentoBox, so to run SurvivalIsland, you must have BentoBox installed. It is not a Bukkit plugin and trying to use it as one will not work.

The acid effects have been removed in favour of a border and more peaceful gameplay.

## Installation

0. Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.
1. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Restart the server.
3. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml.
4. Stop the server.
5. Edit the config.yml how you want.
6. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them.
7. Restart the server.
